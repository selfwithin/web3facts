Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) refers to an organization in which decisions are decided by Smart Contracts.

Typically DAO Smart Contracts are designed to facilitate member voting on particular decisions the organization may make.

To become a memory of a DAO you must buy it's associated cryptocurrency. The more a member owns, the more votes they can submit.

A DAO may also offer members benefits, such as discounted services, or a share in profits.
