A cryptocurrency is a currency which uses cryptography to verify ownership and process / store information.

Cryptocurrencies are designed so that transactions are performed and validated by a large network of computers.

This network of computers also store the Blockchain, a database which contains all transactional information.

Cyptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional currency where ownership and transactions are managed by a government or bank.

They are appealing to individuals who wish to avoid transacting with, or placing trust with, traditional financial institutions.
