Each block within the [Blockchain](#WhatIsABlockchain) contains a unique identifier, or hash, which links
it to the previous block.

If any information changes within a block, it's hash will change, invalidating the
entire chain.

For this reason, the information stored within a [Blockchain](#WhatIsABlockchain) is considered to be permanent.
