A Blockchain is a type of database.

The data stored in a Blockchain is split into many of small sections, or blocks.

Each block contains the data associated with a set of transactions along with a
unique identifier, or hash, which connects it to the previous block.

When a block is complete a unique identifier is generated for it, based on the data it contains.

This unique identifier will be stored in the next block to establish a connection between the two blocks.

Since the unique identifiers are generated based on the data stored in a block,
altering any information within a block will change its unique identifier.
As a result, the connection between an altered and the next block will
be broken, damaging the database.
