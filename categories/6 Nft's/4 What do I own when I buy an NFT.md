When you own an NFT you own the information related to that NFT which is stored
within a Smart Contract. This information typically includes a link to a website
that when visited displays further information about the NFT such as it's name
and a link to an image.

Some NFTs such as Bored Ape Yacht Club state that ownership of the NFT gives the owner
the copyright to the associated image.
