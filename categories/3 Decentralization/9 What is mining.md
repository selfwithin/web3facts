Mining is the process of validating a Block of transactions so that it will be
accepted by the [Node](#WhatIsANode)s within a cryptocurrencies network and added to
the [Blockchain](#WhatIsABlockchain).

The purpose of Mining to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent or malicious transactions.
This is typically achieved using either [Proof of Work](#WhatIsProofOfWork) or [Proof of Stake](#WhatIsProofOfStake), where individual miners
work to validate a Block. Note that networks which utilize [Proof of Stake](#WhatIsProofOfStake) refer to
miners as 'validators'.

A miner is a computer running a program specifically designed to process
transactions for a cryptocurrency network. Miners typically follow the process
outlined [above](#HowAreTransactionsProcessed).

Miners are incentivized by cryptocurrency and [GAS](#WhatIsGAS) fees which are paid to them
when they validate a Block. For example, on the Ethereum network Miners
are rewarded with 2 Ether plus [GAS](#WhatIsGAS).

On cryptocurrency networks which utilize [Proof of Work](#WhatIsProofOfWork), it is difficult for an
individual miner to validate a Block and earn rewards. To increase the likelihood
of earning rewards, miners often group together to form what are called Mining Pools.
Here, a [centralized](#WhatDoesCentralizedMean) service manages the miners and distributes any rewards earned
amongst them. Pooling also exists on [Proof of Stake](#WhatIsProofOfStake) networks where the likelihood
of receiving a reward depends on the size of a miners deposit.
