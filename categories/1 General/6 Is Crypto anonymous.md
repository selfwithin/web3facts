All cryptocurrency and [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) transfers are tied to crypto wallets.

These transactions are all publicly available and can be viewed using tools like [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) or [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).

If the owner of a crypto wallet is unknown to the public, then all of their transactions are anonymous to the public.

However, if a crypto wallet is associated with a crypto exchange then their transactions are not anonymous to the exchange or any government authorities the exchange deals with.

This means maintaining absolute anonymity is not simple and may require complicating
transactions or interacting with less reputable crypto exchanges.
