A Node is a computer which is running a program specifically designed for
a cryptocurrencies network. The program communicates with miners and other Nodes on the network
to verify, process and store transactions.

There are several types of Nodes, the most common include:
-   Archive Node - stores the entire Blockchain
-   Full Node - contains a recent portion of the Blockchain
-   Light Node - contains enough information to verify data received from other Nodes
-   Mining Node - a Node which also participates in mining

There is no direct financial incentive for hosting a Node.
The main incentive is to avoid placing trust in Nodes hosted by others.
Trust is important as Nodes can be modified to misbehave.

Nodes are typically hosted by:
-   Miners
-   Developers
-   Community Members / Enthusiasts
-   Centralized services such as Infura, OpenSea, etc
