The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file storage system.

IPFS consists of a network of computers, or [Node](#WhatIsANode)s, where each [Node](#WhatIsANode) stores copies of the files on the network.

A file will exist on a IPFS server indefinitely, so long as it is "pinned", otherwise it may be collected by the [IPFS Garbage Collector](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/#garbage-collection).

The IPFS network depends on the willingness of each [Node](#WhatIsANode)'s owner to participate in storing files.

To incentivize participation, [Node](#WhatIsANode) owners sell storage space by "pinning" the files a customer uploads. Companies which sell storage space in this way are called Pinning Services.

Pinning services typically charge a monthly fee, but often allow free storage up to a threshold. Popular pinning services include:
-   Infura
-   Pinata
-   Eternum
-   Axel
-   Temporal
