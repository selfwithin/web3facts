Websites which communicate with a [Blockchain](#WhatIsABlockchain) are able to:
-   View transaction information of a user
-   Verify the users ownership of cryptocurrencies or [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s
-   Perform transactions on behalf of the user
-   Execute [Smart Contracts](#WhatIsASmartContract) on behalf of the user

Websites which are stored on [IPFS](#WhatIsIPFS) and resolved using the Ethereum Name Service can do almost
everything a standard website does, but they are currently not supported by all internet browsers.
