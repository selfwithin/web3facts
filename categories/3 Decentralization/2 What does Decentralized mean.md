A Decentralized service is one which is **not** controlled by an individual entity, organization or person.

In the context of Cryptocurrency this means the service is distributed across a large network of computers, or Nodes.

Each of these Nodes work together together to ensure that decisions are made consistently across the entire network.

Amazon provides a comparison between centralized, distributed and decentralized services [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/decentralization-in-blockchain/).
