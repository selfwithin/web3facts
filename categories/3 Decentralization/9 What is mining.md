Mining is the process of validating a Block of transactions so that it will be
accepted by the Nodes within a cryptocurrencies network and added to
the Blockchain.

The purpose of Mining to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent or malicious transactions.
This is typically achieved using either Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, where individual miners
work to validate a Block. Note that networks which utilize Proof of Stake refer to
miners as 'validators'.

A miner is a computer running a program specifically designed to process
transactions for a cryptocurrency network. Miners typically follow the process
outlined [above](#HowAreTransactionsProcessed).

Miners are incentivized by cryptocurrency and GAS fees which are paid to them
when they validate a Block. For example, on the Ethereum network Miners
are rewarded with 2 Ether plus GAS.

On cryptocurrency networks which utilize Proof of Work, it is difficult for an
individual miner to validate a Block and earn rewards. To increase the likelihood
of earning rewards, miners often group together to form what are called Mining Pools.
Here, a centralized service manages the miners and distributes any rewards earned
amongst them. Pooling also exists on Proof of Stake networks where the likelihood
of receiving a reward depends on the size of a miners deposit.
