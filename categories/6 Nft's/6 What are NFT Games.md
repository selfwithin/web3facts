An NFT game is game which uses NFT's for purposes such as:
-   Managing ownership of in-game items
-   Managing player avatars

NFT games are typically centralized as they are developed and controlled by
an individual entity.

The developers of an NFT game can remove support for an NFT within their game at any time. This
means that the NFT will still exist within the associated NFT Smart Contract, but
will not be available for use within the game.
