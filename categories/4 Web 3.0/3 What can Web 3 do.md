Websites which communicate with a Blockchain are able to:
-   View transaction information of a user
-   Verify the users ownership of cryptocurrencies or NFT's
-   Perform transactions on behalf of the user
-   Execute Smart Contracts on behalf of the user

Websites which are stored on IPFS and resolved using the Ethereum Name Service can do almost
everything a standard website does, but they are currently not supported by all internet browsers.
