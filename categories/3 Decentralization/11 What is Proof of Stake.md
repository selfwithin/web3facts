Proof of Stake consists of a network of validators.

Validators are individuals which have deposited, or staked, cryptocurrency
and run a specifically designed program to process transactions.
They are typically discouraged from withdrawing their stake or taking their program
offline with financial penalties.

Each network which relies on Proof of Stake has their own set of requirements
for validators. These requirements can include:

-   A minimum stake (2000 AVAX, 32 ETH, ~$50,000 USD)
-   A minimum uptime (80% on Avalanche)
-   1 to 2 TB SSD Storage
-   16 to 128 GB of RAM

When a Block of transactions is full, the network selects a validator to the
re-execute the transactions and validate the Block so it can be added to the
Blockchain.

The selection process for validators depends on the network, they can be selected
randomly, or based on the how large their stake is.
