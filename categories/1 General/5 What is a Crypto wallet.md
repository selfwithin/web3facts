A crypto wallet contains a set of keys which can be used to prove ownership of cryptocurrencies and [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s.

A key is a long sequence of characters and they are different for each crypto wallet. Below is an example of what a key could look like.

One of the keys stored in the wallet is kept private, only known by the owner of the wallet.
This is called the Private Key and is used to prove ownership of cryptocurrencies and [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s.

The other key is made public, allowing others to transfer ownership of cryptocurrency or [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s to a wallet.

Crypto wallets do not store cryptocurrency or [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s, they can simply be used prove ownership of cryptocurrency or [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s.

If the owner loses access to their wallet, then they will be unable to prove ownership and will no longer be able to access any cryptocurrencies or [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s owned by the wallet.

There are many types of crypto wallets, each with a different method of storing the keys.

The type of crypto wallet used depends who the owner is willing to trust with their keys.
