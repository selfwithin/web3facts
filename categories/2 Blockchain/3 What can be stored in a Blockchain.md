Blockchains can be used to store any type of information. However, there is typically
a limit to how much information can be stored within an individual Block.

In the context of cryptocurrencies, a Blockchain typically stores information regarding
the transfer of currency between wallets or the execution of Smart Contracts.

It is possible to store small images or videos within a Blockchain, however,
it is discouraged by large GAS fees.

Large GAS fees can be avoided by storing images, videos or other files using either
a centralized service or a distributed file storage system such as IPFS. This
reduces the amount of information stored on the Blockchain as it will simply store
a URL to the file.
