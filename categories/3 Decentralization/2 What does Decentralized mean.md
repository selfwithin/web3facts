A Decentralized service is one which is **not** controlled by an individual entity, organization or person.

In the context of Cryptocurrency this means the service is distributed across a large network of computers.
Each computer in this network is called a [Node](#WhatIsANode).

To ensure the network is decentralized, the [Node](#WhatIsANode)s must be able to run independently, without the need
to trust information provided by other [Node](#WhatIsANode)s in the network.

This means each [Node](#WhatIsANode) must store and maintain an identical copy of a [Blockchain](#WhatIsABlockchain).

It also means that each [Node](#WhatIsANode) must follow a strict set of rules when adding
new transactions or when dealing with inconsistencies.

Amazon provides a comparison between [centralized](#WhatDoesCentralizedMean), distributed and decentralized services [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/decentralization-in-blockchain/).
