The motivation for cryptocurrency is to provide an alternative to traditional
banking, where no individual entity is trusted.

A consequence of this is that transactions need to be managed over a large network
of computers, where no single computer is trusted.

Blockchains are used as they:
-   can be consistently distributed across many computers
-   essentially prevent tampering of historical transactions
-   allow any participant to add a transaction
-   can manage disagreements with transactions without trusting an individual computer.
