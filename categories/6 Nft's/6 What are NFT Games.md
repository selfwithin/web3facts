An [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) game is game which uses [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT)s for purposes such as:
-   Managing ownership of in-game items
-   Managing player avatars

[NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) games are typically [centralized](#WhatDoesCentralizedMean) as they are developed and controlled by
an individual entity.

The developers of an [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) game can remove support for an [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) within their game at any time. This
means that the [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) will still exist within the associated [NFT](#WhatIsAnNFT) [Smart Contract](#WhatIsASmartContract), but
will not be available for use within the game.
