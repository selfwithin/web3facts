A Smart Contract is simply computer code which is stored and executed by the Nodes of a
cryptocurrencies network. They are stored on the Nodes indefinitely, until they are deactivated.

The word "Smart" in "Smart Contract" refers to their ability to exist and function
across all Nodes in a network independently. An alternative naming could be
"Decentralized Program".

They are typically used to automate transactions according to a fixed set of rules
defined by the computer code. This set of rules is referred to as the "Contract".
Users who choose to interact with a Smart Contract are agreeing to these
rules.

Smart Contracts are allocated memory within all Nodes to store information such as
wallet addresses, transaction counters, token ids or website links to metadata.

Common examples of where Smart Contracts are used include:
-   When exchanging different types of cryptocurrencies
-   When paying interest to investors
-   When managing a Stablecoin
-   When managing NFTs

## Example Scenario
Consider you run a company which made a profit of $1,000. You need to share the
profits with 10 individuals who invested in your company. This means you need to
transfer each investor $100. Instead of creating the transactions one by one a
Smart Contract can be used to generate the 10 transactions for you.
