A cryptocurrency is a currency which uses cryptography to verify ownership and process / store information.

Cryptocurrencies are designed so that transactions are performed and validated by a large network of computers.

A portion of these computers store an identical database which contains the history of all cryptocurrency transactions. 

The database is split into lots of small sections, or blocks, each which contain a certain number of transactions.

This type of database is called a Blockchain and is designed such that changing an individual transactions will render it invalid.

Cyptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional currency where ownership and transactions are managed by a government or bank.

They are appealing to individuals who wish to avoid transacting with, or placing trust with, traditional financial institutions.
