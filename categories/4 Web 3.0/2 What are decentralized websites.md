A decentralized website is a website which has it's:
-   files stored using a distributed file storage network such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
-   name registered and resolved using the decentralized [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS)

Facts about decentralized websites:
-   they cannot be edited directly, a new copy must be uploaded to IPFS
-   older versions of websites may be stored on IPFS indefinitely
-   GAS fees are paid when the website is updated as the Ethereum Blockchain must be updated
-   annual registration fees are paid to [ENS](https://ens.domains/) for the website's name
-   websites are only decentralized when they are stored across many IPFS nodes
-   most browsers do not yet support IPFS so centralized services are used to retrieve website files
-   websites have long load times if they have not been visited recently
-   centralized services such as [fleek](https://fleek.co/) provide a platform which allows users to setup decentralized websites.
