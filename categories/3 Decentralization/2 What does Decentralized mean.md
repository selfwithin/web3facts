A Decentralized service is one which is **not** controlled by an individual entity, organization or person.

In the context of Cryptocurrency this means the service is distributed across a large network of computers.
Each computer in this network is called a Node.

To ensure the network is decentralized, the Nodes must be able to run independently, without the need
to trust information provided by other Nodes in the network.

This means each Node must store and maintain an identical copy of a Blockchain.

It also means that each Node must follow a strict set of rules when adding
new transactions or when dealing with inconsistencies.
