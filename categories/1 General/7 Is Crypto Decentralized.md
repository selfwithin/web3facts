Today, cryptocurrencies depend on a range of different technology and infrastructure.

It is not possible to state that a cryptocurrency as a whole is decentralized as each aspect must be considered separately.

The below aspects of cryptocurrencies are decentralized:
-   The database which stores all transactions (the Blockchain)
-   The process of validating transactions and executing contracts
-   Web 3.0 services which communicate directly with Blockchain Nodes

The below aspects of cryptocurrencies are not decentralized:
-   Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, etc.
-   Web 3.0 services which communicate with blockchains via centralized companies like [Infura](https://infura.io/faq/general) including:

    -   Crypto Gambling websites
